# Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```text
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
```

**Output:**

```text
[0,1]
```

**Explanation:** Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```text
nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
```

**Output:**

```text
[1,2]
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**

```text
nums = [3,3], target = 6
```

**Output:**

```text
[0,1]
```

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Follow-up:

Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n²) time complexity?
